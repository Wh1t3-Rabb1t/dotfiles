# USER SCRIPTS

Scripts are added to the fpath and autoloaded on first call.

Organization is loosely based on the tools they rely on / utility they
serve, but some overlap is unavoidable, (we could just dump 80% of scripts
in a directory called fzf but that wouldn't be practical).

Hidden files / directories mark scripts that I don't want to populate cheat
sheet search results. Scripts bound to hotkeys that are executed many times
per day for example only pollute results with commands that I don't need to
be reminded of.
